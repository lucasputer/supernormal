#### Abstract  
The notion of supernormality defined by Zeev Rudnick a few years ago.
The few things known about supernormality are not published. Benjamin Weiss from the Einstein Institute of Math de Hebrew University gave on June 16th, 2010 a lecture on “Random-like behavior
in deterministic systems” where the notion of supernormal sequences is described under the name of Poisson generic sequences.
In this lecture, Weiss claims that almost every real number is supernormal and that the notion of supernormality is stronger than the classical notion of normaility.
Weiss also states that the most famous example of a normal number, the Champernowne number, is not supernormal. And finally he leaves open the problem of giving an explicit construction of a supernormal number.
In this thesis we give the complete proof that the binary Champernowne number is not supernormal.

The whole thesis pdf and latex files are available in the [tesis folder](tesis/tesis.pdf)

The supernormality tests for Champernowne, Levin Theorem 1 & 2 sequences, the Stoneham number, and the PRNGs Rule 30 and Mersenne twister are located in the [notebooks folder](/notebooks).
